#Technologies used 
    This project was created using Mongoose, express, ejs, mongoDB, and Heroku.

#Approach Taken
    The first thing I did after coming up with the idea for this project was write out a json document with the structure that I would use to store all characters. This helped me understand what data would need to be added and manipulated and allowed for easy changes when certain parts didn't work. After this I started on getting all of tge routes to work so that characters could be added, deleted, viewed, and edited.

#Unsolved Problems
    Currently the unsolved problems on this project are adding a user login function so that multiple people can use this database. 
    Adding in an option to add images to the characters.
